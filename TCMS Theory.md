# (TCMS) Theory

The term **Transcendental Compact Multidimensional Set Theory** refers to the study of sets that have the following properties:

* They are transcendental, meaning that they [do not contain any algebraic numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number).
* They are compact, meaning that they are [closed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) and [bounded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set).
* They are multidimensional, meaning that they have [more than two dimensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane).

This type of [set theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#:~:text=Set%20theory%20is%20the%20branch,to%20mathematics%20as%20a%20whole.) is a [newly invented field of study](https://github.com/Az-Net/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md#who-are-we), but it has the potential to be very important for understanding the structure of [complex data](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis). It has the potential to shed light on some of the most fundamental questions in mathematics. For example, it could help us to understand the nature of infinity and the relationship between sets of different sizes.

The study of [transcendental numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) is already a complex and fascinating topic, and the addition of [compactness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space) and [multidimensionality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_system) would only add to the challenge and the potential rewards.

TCMS Theory has the potential to help us understand infinity in a way that we never have before. However, it is also possible that it could lead us down a rabbit hole of madness. Only time will tell what the true potential this field of study has.

# Extending Transcendental Numbers

The concept of transcendental numbers extends to higher dimensions through the notion of algebraic independence.

Transcendental numbers, such as pi (π) and e, are numbers that cannot be expressed as a finite ratio of two integers. They are often characterized by their infinite and non-repeating decimal expansions. Extending transcendental numbers into more than two dimensions involves utilizing mathematical concepts and constructions that go beyond the familiar Euclidean space.

One approach is to consider complex numbers, which are numbers of the form z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined as i^2 = -1. Complex numbers can be visualized as points on a two-dimensional plane, called the complex plane. Transcendental complex numbers are complex numbers that cannot be expressed as the root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients. Examples of transcendental complex numbers include e^(πi) and √i.

Another approach to extending transcendental numbers into higher dimensions is through the concept of hypercomplex numbers. Hypercomplex numbers are generalizations of complex numbers, which extend the real number system to include the imaginary unit i, defined as √-1. Hypercomplex numbers extend the concept above further by introducing additional imaginary units, allowing for the representation of numbers in higher-dimensional spaces.

For instance, quaternions are a type of hypercomplex number system that can represent numbers in four-dimensional space. Quaternions are denoted by the letter Q and can be expressed as q = a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers and i, j, and k are imaginary units that satisfy the following multiplication rules:

* ij = k, jk = i, ki = j  
* ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j  

Similarly, octonions and sedenions are extensions of quaternions, representing numbers in eight and sixteen dimensions, respectively. These hypercomplex number systems provide a mathematical framework for extending transcendental numbers into higher-dimensional spaces.

Finally, another approach to extending transcendental numbers into higher dimensions is through the concept of higher-dimensional manifolds. Manifolds are mathematical spaces that locally resemble Euclidean space but may have a global structure that is different. For example, a sphere is a two-dimensional manifold that is locally flat but globally curved.

Higher-dimensional manifolds can be used to represent transcendental numbers by embedding them into these spaces. For instance, the number pi can be embedded into a three-dimensional manifold known as the Möbius strip. The Möbius strip is a one-sided surface with a single edge that twists through itself. By embedding pi into the Möbius strip, one can visualize its behavior in three dimensions.

Extending transcendental numbers into more than two dimensions is an active area of mathematical research, with potential applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. By understanding the behavior of transcendental numbers in higher dimensions, researchers can gain new insights into the nature of numbers and their applications in the real world.
