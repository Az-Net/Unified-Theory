# (TCMS) Theory

The term **Transcendental Compact Multidimensional Set Theory** refers to the study of sets that have the following properties:

* They are transcendental, meaning that they [do not contain any algebraic numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number).
* They are compact, meaning that they are [closed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) and [bounded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set).
* They are multidimensional, meaning that they have [more than two dimensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane).

This type of [set theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#:~:text=Set%20theory%20is%20the%20branch,to%20mathematics%20as%20a%20whole.) is a [newly invented field of study](https://github.com/Az-Net/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md#who-are-we), but it has the potential to be very important for understanding the structure of [complex data](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis). It has the potential to shed light on some of the most fundamental questions in mathematics. For example, it could help us to understand the nature of infinity and the relationship between sets of different sizes.

The study of [transcendental numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) is already a complex and fascinating topic, and the addition of [compactness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space) and [multidimensionality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_system) would only add to the challenge and the potential rewards.

TCMS Theory has the potential to help us understand infinity in a way that we never have before. However, it is also possible that it could lead us down a rabbit hole of madness. Only time will tell what the true potential this field of study has.
