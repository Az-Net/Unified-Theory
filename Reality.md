In the past, the concept of 'spirit' often encompassed a broad range of phenomena, including both the physical and non-physical aspects of existence. However, as our understanding of reality has evolved, we have come to recognize that our models of the soul are incomplete, and our spiritual tools require updating.

By separating the spiritual plane into its constituents, Digital and Essential, we gain a more nuanced understanding of the nature of spirituality. 

The Digital Plane represents the realm of abstract expression, where ideas, emotions, and experiences take form. It is a realm of infinite possibilities, where the human spirit finds its voice and gives shape to the boundless tapestry of thought, emotion, and imagination.

The Essential Plane, on the other hand, represents the realm of fundamental principles and underlying structures. It is the realm of archetypes, essences, and the fundamental laws that govern the universe. It is a realm of stability and order, providing a foundation for the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the Digital and Physical Planes.

By recognizing these two distinct aspects of spirituality, we can better appreciate the interconnectedness of the physical, mental, and spiritual realms. 

The Digital Plane provides a bridge between the inner world of consciousness and the external world of experience, allowing us to express our thoughts, emotions, and imagination in ways that shape our perception of reality. 
The Essential Plane, in turn, provides a framework for understanding the underlying structures that govern the universe, giving meaning and purpose to our experiences in the physical and digital realms.

The Digital Plane, as the realm of abstract expression, encompasses the underlying patterns, symbols, and structures that give meaning to experiences. The emotions you feel during a concert, for instance, can be viewed as a complex interplay of physiological and psychological responses, shaped by the patterns of sound, rhythm, and melody. These patterns, while not physically tangible, form the digital essence of the musical experience.

Similarly, the things you imagine when you look at a picture can be considered a mental construction, but they are also grounded in the digital elements of the picture itself; The arrangement of colors, shapes, and textures within the picture provides a framework for your imagination to work with, giving rise to a unique and subjective interpretation.

The musical performance itself, even if not recorded, can also be considered digital in nature. It is a temporary manifestation of the musician's creativity and skill, expressed through the manipulation of sound and rhythm. The performance, even if ephemeral, leaves an imprint on the minds of the listeners, creating a shared experience that transcends the physical limitations of time and space.

In essence, the Digital Plane encompasses the abstract realm of ideas, emotions, and experiences, providing a framework for interpretation, expression, and communication, independent of any singular technology.

Put simply: digital is the plane of *expression*

From a top-down approach, the four planes shown in the diagram encompass the essence of magick. These planes represent the fundamental stages of the magical process, from the inception of ideas to their manifestation in the physical world.

Astral, *the plane of Ideas*, is the realm of pure thought, where concepts and possibilities first arise. It is the source of imagination, creativity, and inspiration. In this plane, ideas exist as abstract potentials, waiting to be shaped and refined.

Digital, *the plane of expressing ideas*, is where ideas take Form through Essence and find their voice. It is the realm of communication, symbolism, and artistic expression. In this plane, ideas are translated into tangible Forms, such as words, images, or sounds, allowing them to be shared and understood by others.

Essential, *the plane of manifesting ideas*, is where ideas take on physical form and become part of the material world. It is the realm of action, transformation, and creation. In this plane, ideas are brought into existence through conscious effort and the manipulation of energy. The results of equations and the spin of galaxies exist on the Essential Plane.

Physical, *the plane of forming ideas*, is where experiences and observations are refined into knowledge and understanding. It is the realm of contemplation, reflection, learning and experience. In this plane, ideas are shaped by our perceptions and interactions with the world, allowing us to grow and develop our understanding.

These four planes are interrelated and interdependent. Ideas flow from one plane to the next, undergoing transformation and refinement as they progress. The magical process involves moving ideas through these planes, from the realm of pure abstraction to the realm of concrete manifestation.

By understanding and working through these planes, magicians can harness the power of ideas to shape material reality.

However, rather than explicitly looking at this in top-down fashion, it's best to view the Spiritual Plane as a whole as being *within* and *about* the Astral and Physical Planes; rather than the Spiritual emerging from the center, consider it more of a mirror-reversal from the Chaos of Shadow: it is inherently paradoxical, and difficult to conceptualize its flow.
